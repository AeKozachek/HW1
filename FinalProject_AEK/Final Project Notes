Update for Tide clock motor issues. I have recently installed my Peristaltic pump from adafruit(https://www.adafruit.com/product/1150?gclid=CN_dhsD2odMCFUGTfgodWm8Cbg.
I Installed it into my ardunio connected to my H Bridge and used. My working code form earlier in the project and the pump wont activate. The only diffrence i can find Is that the Test motor is a 5 volt DC motor and the Peristaltic pump is a Geared down 12 volt DC motor. Also when i had the Peristaltic pump hooked up the H Bridge got very hot. Any Help in sorting out this problem would be greatly appreciated!
