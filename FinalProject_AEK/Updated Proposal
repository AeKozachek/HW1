My updated propsal for my final project is a ocean tide clock. This will be a visual representation of current level of the tide.
This will be accomplished by using a controlled water level connected to a Real Time Clock. 


For the tide clock a pump would be turned on at a specific time. 
when the water level reaches the appropriate level the pump would shut off and a solenoid that actuates a drain would 
open and lower the water level to the appropriate low level. 
once at the low point the solenoid would shut and the cycle could repeat moving up roughly an hour everyday 
for example if it started at 9:00 today tomorrow it would start at 10:00.

My Updated Parts List is going to be:
peristaltic pump(This is a DC motor and this pump works in both forward and revers) 
H Bridge
Arduino Uno
Water Level reistor
RTC(Real Time Clock)
Bread Board
Two Water Tanks
Sand
Water
